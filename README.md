The aims of this assignment can be broken down into five major themes:
Understanding the Problem Space. Problem spaces in which we build software can often be very complex. This assignment involves some geospatial and mathematical ideas (though you won’t have to do any mathematical derivation yourself) with a series of multifaceted interacting entities. Take some time to understand the problem by reading the spec a few times and clarifying anything you need to.
Thoughtful Planning. You’ll need to model the domain by defining the entities present in the domain and their relationships. Start with a very rough pen and paper draft of this, you’ll be able to iterate on your design as you become more familiar with the problem space. 
Programming by Contract. The specification outlines everything you have to implement - you’ll need to implement your solution according to the rules and test your solution to ensure correctness.
Robust Programming. In developing the system, you will need to maintain good quality programming practices including code style as well as the overall design. One approach you can take is, for each task, to implement a rough solution to pass the tests, go back and refactor and make it nicely designed. Then repeat for the next task.
Building Blocks. This assignment will build your skills in working with Java, the VSCode IDE and thinking critically that will help you throughout the rest of the course.
