The aims of this assignment can be broken down into five major themes:
Understanding the Problem Space. Problem spaces in which we build software can often be very complex. This assignment involves some geospatial and mathematical ideas (though you won’t have to do any mathematical derivation yourself) with a series of multifaceted interacting entities. Take some time to understand the problem by reading the spec a few times and clarifying anything you need to.
Thoughtful Planning. You’ll need to model the domain by defining the entities present in the domain and their relationships. Start with a very rough pen and paper draft of this, you’ll be able to iterate on your design as you become more familiar with the problem space. 
Programming by Contract. The specification outlines everything you have to implement - you’ll need to implement your solution according to the rules and test your solution to ensure correctness.
Robust Programming. In developing the system, you will need to maintain good quality programming practices including code style as well as the overall design. One approach you can take is, for each task, to implement a rough solution to pass the tests, go back and refactor and make it nicely designed. Then repeat for the next task.
Building Blocks. This assignment will build your skills in working with Java, the VSCode IDE and thinking critically that will help you throughout the rest of the course.


1. Preamble and Problem
A great deal of today's technology uses satellites which orbit the Earth in one way or another. For example, tagging photographs with their location, telecommunications, and even missile control systems. There are currently 4,550 active satellites (as of 2022) orbiting the Earth all together.
In the far future, society has become advanced to the point where they have begun to occupy a series of moons and asteroids around the planet Jupiter. Individuals rely on satellites for all their communication desires. Three major satellites exist around Jupiter.
This assessment aims to provide you with design experience for a non-trivial system. You will be architecting and modelling how these multiple satellites will communicate and function with various devices. The form of communication that you will be simulating is a simplified version of the modern internet, simply just file transfer. You can either upload a file to a satellite from a device, download a file from a satellite to a device, or send a file from a satellite to a satellite.
Your solution should adopt an Object-Oriented approach that utilises concepts such as abstraction, encapsulation, composition, and inheritance, as taught in lectures.
