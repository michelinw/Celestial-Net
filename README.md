# Introduction

Welcome to CelestialNet, an Object-Oriented framework designed during the course COMP2511 for simulating satellite communication in an advanced future where society has expanded to occupy moons and asteroids around Jupiter. This framework focuses on modeling the communication between multiple satellites and devices, emphasizing file transfers as the primary form of communication.

# Project Overview

## Aim
The primary goal of CelestialNet is to architect and model a non-trivial system where satellites and devices interact in a sophisticated manner. This involves simulating file transfers among satellites and devices, allowing for the addition and removal of these entities at runtime.

## Objectives
1. Model Satellites and Devices
2. Implement Runtime Addition/Removal of Satellites and Devices
3. Design 'Queries' for Current World State
4. Enable File Transfers Between Satellites

## Skills Demonstrated
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Composition
- Inheritance

# Stages of Developmen
## Stage 1: Modeling Satellites and Devices
Create a robust object model for satellites and devices, incorporating key attributes and behaviors. Utilize concepts of abstraction and encapsulation to represent these entities effectively.

## Stage 2: Runtime Addition/Removal
Implement mechanisms to dynamically add and remove satellites and devices during runtime. Ensure that the consequences of such actions are appropriately managed within the framework.

## Stage 3: 'Queries' for World State
Design a set of queries that provide insights into the current state of the world, including information about existing devices and satellites.

## Stage 4: File Transfers
Enable satellites and devices to send files to each other. Implement a simplified version of the modern internet's file transfer mechanism.

# Key features
- Dynamic addition/removal of satellites and devices
- Query system for retrieving current world state
- File transfer functionality between satellites and devices

# Reflections

## Soft Skills Demonstrated
- Problem-solving in the context of dynamic system changes
- Effective collaboration in designing and implementing complex interactions
- Thoughtful planning by modeling the domain, defining entities, and establishing relationships

## Learning
Gain insights into architecting non-trivial systems, emphasizing the importance of abstraction, encapsulation, composition, and inheritance. Strengthen skills in geospatial and mathematical problem-solving. Learning programming by contract, adhering to the specification as a guide, implementing solutions according to the rules, testing implementations rigorously to ensure correctness and functionality.

## Techincal Knowledge
Enhance your understanding of object-oriented design principles through the practical implementation of a satellite communication framework. Sharpen Java skills, VSCode proficiency, and critical thinking abilities.

# Conclusion
CelestialNet stands as a testament to the advanced capabilities of future society, where satellites and devices seamlessly communicate in a sophisticated manner. This framework, built on solid object-oriented principles, provides a foundation for modeling dynamic systems with runtime changes. The assignment's themes of understanding the problem space, thoughtful planning, programming by contract, robust programming, and building blocks contribute to a holistic learning experience. CelestialNet is ready to inspire and guide future architects in building advanced communication systems for the stars.
